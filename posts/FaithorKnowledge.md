I’ve always felt like a ‘doubting Thomas’ at best and a hypocrite at worst.  Without belief we are lost!  Because of this my favorite bible verse has been Mark 9:24, “I believe, help my unbelief”

During yesterday’s service we sang an old hymn with this verse:

“And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight”

This caught my attention and circled in my head until this morning when something clicked.  

I think I’ve blurred my understanding of these terms when evaluating truth:  belief/faith and knowledge.  I was thinking them somehow the same.  So in my head, i felt the need to have proof of the truth of Christ.  

Knowing requires proof and I lack enough proof to be comfortable sharing proof with others!  

But that is not what’s required.  We don’t need proof (knowledge) we need belief or faith which is different.  

Faith is not knowledge because faith allows for a lack of proof.  Knowing is based on some sort of proof.  

That said, we are asked to have true faith not dead faith in the truth of Christ.

Let me explain using examples:

Let’s say i stop by a place where people bungee jump.  I have concerns about its safety but am told it’s safe and I simply believe it.  Next i put the harness on and jump.  - this an example of real faith. I didn’t really know, it could have broken but in my example all went well - lol 

An example of dead faith would be the above example, but I choose NOT to jump, for whatever reason, even though I believed it was safe.  No trust was required, just an acceptance of it being safe.  This is worthless faith.

An example of knowing (knowledge) would be if i’d hung around and watched several heavy people jump safely first or if I had the rope taken to a shop and had its tensile strength tested and certified using the scientific method.  But even then if i did all  of this testing and still had NOT jumped, it would be dead knowledge and worthless. 

So to summarize to be a Christian is more than the acceptance of the truth of Christ but less than being able to prove the truth of Christ.  We only need to accept and trust in Christ.  A living faith.

One other thought.  Regardless of what we believe or have knowledge of, does not change the truth.  One can be wrong even with ton’s of proof.  The truth is always the truth.  We seek truth and over time find different understandings of how to test for truth.  I’d suggest all knowledge is really just based on the faith of our ever changing proofs.
