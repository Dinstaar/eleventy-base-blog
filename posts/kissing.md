Perhaps one of my most earnest request to God  came during my teen years.  I think it was the summer of 1976.  I would be a sophomore in high school.    With sincerity, I prayed for someone to spend my life with.  I’m not sure I gave much thought to my future at that time in my life, but knew whatever became of me that I did not want to be alone.  God soon answered that prayer.
I know it can sound trite, but looking back after 38 years of marriage, this was truly a match made in heaven.
Don’t misunderstand, all has not been bless.  For my part, I struggled being a good husband and especially early on, despised this marvelous gift desiring the “freedom” others had.  We were married right after high school.  I was 19 and she 18.  We had our first child shortly before I turned 21.
God sure knew what he was doing, because she never kicked me to the curb even though I certainly deserved it.  She has stood with me thick and thin.  I can’t think of any major accomplishment of my life that can’t be directly contributed for her.  My success in employment, as a father, even in my current goal of serving Christ.  I’ll praise God always for every day and year that we have together and with each moment we grow closer.
Prayer for today,
“Father thank you for entrusting us with each other.  You designed marriage and family.  It was your will and a gift for us.  You saw the need far ahead of time.  You knew how lonely one can be alone and how beneficial marriage can be.  I praise you Father for every day and year we have together.   With each moment we grow closer and through each other we grow closer to You. 
My hope and prayer is that others searching may reach to You for help and find their lifetime mate.  And for those already married to discover the truth of this wonderful blessing.”   
Amen
