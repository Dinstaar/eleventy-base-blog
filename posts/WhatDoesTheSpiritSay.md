The Word tells us to grow, get past the milk.  The foundations have been laid, build on it and walk in the spirit in communion with God.
  
Man’s says: do this and that, meet on Sunday, join, commit to our mission.  Man quotes the scriptures like a draft number.  My mind reels, using the same logic, that of man, I fixate on why this assembly doesn’t follow all that is written.  Where is the body, the unity?  Is this really what is intended?  I stumble again and again.

Years earlier, seeking with zeal, the Spirit told me to introduce myself to this one person.  I’d observed the man worshiping with real tears and dedication.  The audience was large and after service he quickly departed. I was stuck in line waiting to exit.  After several attempts, one Sunday I managed to set myself strategically, I was going to say hello and reach my hand out to introduce myself.  He slips by me unobservant and heads out quickly.  I was not going to be beaten again.  I was on a mission, God sent.

I chased after him, out the door, past the waiting pastor greeting the congregants.  No time for pleasantries.  He was already at his car but not yet inside.  I reached out my hand and said hello.  He pulled back, frightened.  It was then that I discovered that this middle age man was a child inside.  I was able to back away to restore his comfort.  I felt awkward walking back in.  Later learning he was special needs and was waiting for his elderly father to exit and drive him home.

I struggled afterwards.  Why would the Spirit send me on this task?  Did I misunderstand or make it up in my head (doubt abounded)?

So today, here I’m again in that familiar situation.  My toes again aching for another stumble.  Why did the Spirit lead me to this place?  A theme of the last several years.   Inside my problem-solving logic tries to figure my role, how to influence, when to stay quiet. Your Damned if you do and Damned if you don’t, says the spirit of lies.  You’d be better on your own.  Trust your feelings, besides they don’t want you. LIES, Lies, lies….

The Spirit says, step on the foundation already built and trust it.  Put away your calculations, this foundation will endure and hold up to whatever is to be built and regardless of who’s building beside you. 
 
When we start walking in the spirit, we try to hear the Spirit and step out in faith.  But do we really have the faith to trust there is a purpose once we made the first step and are left wondering why?
  
So, He sent you for a task.  He’s said go and you went.  Congratulations! But now you’re not sure why your here.  Your uncomfortable and begin to hear the familiar voices of man.  You engage your problem-solving skills yourself; you weigh your options.  You start to listen to the lies again.
  
Why don’t you trust?  If He sent you and you know He did; surely, He’ll not condemn you for staying, waiting, being on alert for some unknown action.
  
You seek Him earnestly and then the voice that spoke creation tells your spirit come here and still you say, “wouldn’t God prefer this or that?”  You are either weak minded or arrogant.  You’ve studied His Word; you know His voice.  You know His law has been written on your heart.  Why do we still allow the voices outside and the wisdom of man to take control?

Regardless, here I am measuring the foundation and testing Grace, is it truly as wide as the east is from the west. Thank God it is!
  
Repent (wash, rinse, repeat) and back to waiting.  May the Spirit guide us daily and may we be faithful to trust in His wisdom……  

Amen.
