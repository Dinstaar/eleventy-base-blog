It hard to describe the peace and tranquility one feels when they step back into their favorite memories.   I suspect we all have that one place that just seems to rejuvenate us, for me it’s the mountains of  West Virginia – aka “God’s Country” where my mom’s family is from.

I’ve never lived there, but as a child it was our routine pilgrimage.  The photo gives no justice to the mountain and river behind the homestead, nor does it capture the love that flows from those that live there.

This last weekend, I picked up my mom, now in her late 80’s and took her back home to visit with her sister and other family.  She wanted to go back before the snow came, and I was more that happy to journey with her.  While there, I not only was able to see the natural beauty of the mountain and  river behind their home, but I got an unfiltered glimpse of the deep waters of my aunt’s soul.
My aunt is the salt of the earth, like her mom before her.  She is the picture of kindness and goodness.

My mom and aunt were sitting talking, just catching up.  I sat on the sideline interjecting now and then, but mostly just observing.  Just the typical family stories, often a repeat that I’d heard many time before.  But trivial conversation turned into a something greater, a life lesson for me to strive to emulate.

I recall my mom mentioning how she had three books at home that she was actively reading and laughing about how my father, if he were still living, would never understand why anyone would read three books at the same time.  Mom is a book worm and has no issue stopping and starting different stories, its just how she does it.

My aunt smiled and said it would be difficult reading more than one at a time for her.  She went on to explain how she always reads through her bible one book at a time first to last.  She said, that several years ago her pastor had provided a reading plan to the church and she gave it a try.  She said it bounced back and fourth between the sixty six books and she did not like it so she had to revert back to her method because it was just too confusing his way.

I noticed how excited, or maybe better described, how joyful she became.  As she talked about reading the bible her eyes beamed and it was almost like she was talking to herself, but still addressing my mom.  I don’t know how many times she’s read it, but from the conversation at least yearly for decades.

She said that in times past, there were some books in the bible that she dreaded getting to, but others that she just loved.  But now she said she looks forward to reading all of them.

She said that many years back, she’d come across a word that she’d never noticed before.  She said she’d read it dozens of times, but never noticed this particular word.  It added new insight to the text.  She could not understand how she’d not seen it before.  She told us that she asked my uncle to open his bible and see if that word was there.  She laughed and said that of course it was.  Every since that moment, she said, she’d always look forward to finding something new when reading.  She followed up with,  “every year I do”.
At this point I was holding back a tear.  Not so much the words spoken, but the glow on her face as she talked.  I could tell she was retelling, perhaps reliving, very special moments in her life.  It was just so touching to see how much my aunt loved reading God’s word.

Prayer for today:  Father please give us the drive to seek you with such passion.  Let our love be like a deep river.  Let us seek you in our prayers, in our study and in our very act of living.  Father, let us be a testimony to others like my aunt.  Let our love for you beam out like a guiding light.
Amen
