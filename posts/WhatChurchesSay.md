Believers are the living temple, holy ground where the Spirit dwells among us.  YET

  Some little churches mock the mega churches for their money, their barista, their lack of family togetherness, and how easy one can be invisible in a crowd.

  Some big churches mock the little church for it’s cultishness, its lack of growth, and isolation from the world.

  Some established churches mock the others for their worldliness, loss of tradition and even how they dress and stype of worship music.

  An outreach church mocks might have disdain and mock other assemblies as dying, for they don’t evangelize with zeal.

  and I, I mocked the young man at Kroger who dressed so oddly.  

The Spirit must grieve at our thoughts.
