![We left out from Ohio on a sunny Saturday (19 June 2010)](/img/IMG00033-20100619-0743.jpg?raw=true "")

It had been nine days since we left.  We’d spent a few days in Bar Harbor and we were now homeward bound.  We stopped for the night at a motel near Montpelier, VT with plans to jump on the interstate the next morning and continue to head toward Burlington, VT and then across Lake Champlain and into the Adirondacks.

It was 9:30 AM on the 29th.  It had rained all night and was still down pouring this Monday morning.  Rain was forecasted to continue all day long.  We could give in and spend the day and night at the motel, but what’s the adventure in that?  So we choose to ride and loaded up and hit the road.  Looking back at rainfall records, this had been a very wet day at Montpelier, accumulating over an inch and a half or rain.

The ride proved difficult on the interstate.  There was a lot of pooling of water on the road, visibility was very poor and with the traffic it was just too much.  We exited the highway, set the GPS to avoid the interstate and allowed it to figure another way.

I was glad to be away from the big trucks, but my comfort was only short lived.  We ended up traveling up Mill Brook road.  This took us across the Green Mountains near the Appalachian Gap.

The road was small and winding, the type without a centerline.  We were steadily traveling up the mountain, but what caught my attention more was the creek that the road was following.  This small creek was now raging and overflowing its banks and taking up precious pavement of the road.  At one point nearly three quarters of the road was underwater.  I was considering turning around.  But we were now beginning a steep upgrade and I did not want to try and swing the bike around on the incline.

So up and up the road we continued.  The road had a couple of extreme hairpins and near the top it became VERY steep.  This would be a good motorcycle road in dry and clear conditions with beautiful views.  Although to be honest, it is not like some of our favorite bike roads in the Smokey Mts.  That said, it did climb over 1,000 feet in about 1.5 miles and riding in the rain and not trusting the GPS to lead us over a cliff sure added to the concern.

To make matters worse, as we reached a high point just before descending, visibility went to zero.  I could not see more than a few feet ahead.  Just then, a pull off appeared to the right.  I left the road and came to a stop.  Paula climbed off.  I asked if she would walk to the guardrail to see if she could even see the road.  To be honest, I just needed a few moments alone to gather my thoughts.

In my head, I analyzed the situation.  I could go back, but to what?  The road might be completely flooded by now?  I feared going forward, I absolutely could not see the road and the turns were deadly.  I could stay where we were until the weather cleared, but without shelter and sitting on a wide flat spot on top of a mountain in the rainstorm seemed like a bad idea.  What if lightning!

I must admit, I was in a bit of pickle and felt nearly in a panic.  I said a quick prayer, but was still looking for my own solution.  Paula returned to the bike reporting the obvious, that she could not see anything.  We could barely see our own hands.  I repeated to her the options and she agreed all were bad, but said she had prayed and asked God to clear a path.  She suggested we just go for it.  She was much more confident than me, she felt God had our backs because we found the pullover out of nowhere.  She was ready to roll.

So I cranked the engine over, she climbed on and off we went.  My heart was in my throat.  My plan, if I had one at all, was to just creep on forward as slowly as possible.  I was only hoping that I could see just a little better as we started down.  All I needed was to at least see the road 10 foot ahead.  There was no traffic, I do not recall if I even considered being run over by other vehicles.

Almost immediately, even before my rear tire hit the road everything amazingly changed.  It was like the hand of God moved the darkness away.  The sun shined and after a few more moments, we could see for miles and miles.  I can’t explain the feeling.

Some clouds hung around the rest of the ride into New York, but not another drop of rain hit us.  We traveled through the Adirondacks and stopped as planned at a quaint little camp, the Oxbow Lake Motel (pictured below).

I gave than and still give now all the glory for that day to God.  He cleared our path.

Prayer for Today:  Father, thank you for this very day.  Every breath is a true miracle and we are so thankful.  Help us not to wait until we are frozen with fear or worry to be able to see Your hand in our life.  We were awestruck then, yet we know Your hand is holding us always.    You cleared the path across that mountain for us then, but more importantly, You have given us a pathway to You through Calvary.  Amen.
