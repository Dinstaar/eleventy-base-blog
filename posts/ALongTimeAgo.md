As I continue to log entries to this blog, I’ll be jumping back in time occasionally to share past experiences.  Some simple, yet relevant facts to help describe my walk with God.  This post is such an example discussing my baptism.   I also plan in future post to share my personal testimony through the years.  To me all amazing God stories.  Others can judge for themsleves, but for now my baptism.
As my memory serves me, I was saved and baptized in 1972.  I was twelve at the time.  This was a period when my mom was taking us regularly to a Baptist church somewhere near Lockbourne AFB, Ohio.
Its all a bit cloudy in my memory, but I truly believe I had a heart felt conversion.  This was a very tumultuous time for my family.  My dad had spent a year in Vietnam and before he returned my oldest brother was shipped there.  Dad returned in 1968, but my brother never came home, KIA in Jun 1969.   We were transferred to Ohio, then dad got reassigned to Louisiana again for a year while mom and us kids stayed in Ohio.
I believe we were living in base housing at the time of my baptism, but I’m not 100% sure.  I recall that dad was at my baptism, so we may have already move off of base and into our new home.  My parents purchased their house shortly after my dad retired in 1972.
After this, we went to a few churches and attended a couple services now and then, but this never became a habit again while I was living at home.
Even without a church and never really studying the bible, I never denied God or walked away from my faith.  I’ve always held Him with a great level of reverence.  But during that time, I never really grew spiritually and chased after desires of the world.  I never tried to develop a relationship with God.  I can only imagine that this grieved the Holy Spirit.  I basically chased my tail in the desert for the next four decades.    Even so, He never abandoned me and for that I’m eternally thankful.
God is good.
