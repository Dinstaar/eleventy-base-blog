“You Hypocrite!” or “You’re not worthy”can often be heard in whispers from within.  This can happen anytime we set out to do something good, pure or righteous.

Who is that speaking?  Is it of the devil?  Perhaps at times, but more than likely, its just one’s own old self.  The former us.  In Christianese talk, its the flesh speaking.   Yea, it’s all a little confusing.

So are we double minded or worse, schizophrenic?  It might seem that way to a non-Christian or someone immature in the faith.  But it’s actually a natural conflict fighting within us.  A result of our salvation.  A fight that our spirit can and should win.

When we are reborn our spirit desires to walk in the light.  Our regenerated spirit assumes the driver seat focused on following our Lord.  This is because we are under new management – Jesus.

The struggle is that we still have free choice.   We choose who is driving.  It is either our young spirit or the old self.  But even when the spirit wins out, the worldly lust and desires of the old self are still lurking and waiting.  He is hoping for a weak moment so that temptation can win.  The old self wants to quickly grab the steering wheel to drive us down the wrong road.

But even though our spirit maintains control, that pesky old self will not just sit by quietly.  The hunger for the desires of the world are strong within him and he tries to condemn, shame and confuse the newly birthed spirit into paralysis.  For him, going nowhere is better than listen to the new management.

I fear a lot of Christians suffer from this condition, frozen into what is called “spiritual uselessness”.  Perhaps this is the meaning of neither hot nor cold.  In any case, it is not a good place to be.

So what can we do when we are frozen into inaction.  It’s really simple, Double Tap!

Pull out that spiritual, pump action, double barrel, 12 gage shotgun and fire.  Not just once, but follow-up with a second slug or two.  Just like in the movie “Zombie Land”.  Never take it for granted that the old self is dead. Always give a extra slug, just to be sure.  And, like in most zombie movies, that old self will keep getting back up, so keep plenty of ammo handy.

So, when you’re frozen into inaction by worry that you are not good enough, or that you’re being a fake because deep down inside you are told your soul  in nothing but black tar and your a hypocrite, then that’s your clue.  It’s now time to pull out the spiritual shotgun again.

For me the shotgun symbolizes the deliberate acknowledgement that I’ve actually been redeemed through Christ.  I mix the shot adding a few pellets of thankfulness, along with a rebuke of double OO buck.  I also remind myself that the old me has no real control anymore, while blasting a rebuke at the old self reminding him that we are under new management and have a new driver.  It can take a couple repeats, so fire away and always  — Double tap!

Just the blast of acknowledgement, thankfulness, and a self rebuke goes a long way in our spiritual walk.  I’d suggest daily target practice even if the old self is out of sight for a long time.  Never let your guard down, and yes, always Double Tap!!!
Prayer for today:  Father thank you so much that we’ve been redeemed and now are able to walk a righteous path.  Help us to avoid the temptations of this world and to serve You our Lord and Savior.  Amen.
